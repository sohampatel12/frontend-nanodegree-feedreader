# Feed Reader Testing Project 

This project contains the implementation of a testing technique using jasmine. Various tests were written to verify the correct working of the html file i.e. the Feed Reader.

# Steps to run application

- To start the app, open index.html in your browser. 

- The tests were written in the feedreader.js file. The test results
appears at the bottom of the index.html page.

- Tests that are green have passed and red have failed.

## The tests:

0. Test to make sure that the allFeeds variable has been defined and that it is not empty.
1. Test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
2. Test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
3. Test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.
4. Test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
5. Test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
6. Test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
7. Implement error handling for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access.
